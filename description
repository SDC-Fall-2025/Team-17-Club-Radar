This is SDC Fall 2025, Team 17 repository info.

For infrastructure of this repository, read `info/hier'.
Most notably:

  + For source code of the project itself, checkout HEAD.
  + For source code of the team Wiki site, checkout `refs/heads/gh-pages'.
  + For archive of the wisc-sdc-fa25-team "mailing" list, checkout
    `refs/heads/list/master'.
  + For a best-effort mirror of every GitWeb I have published branches in this
    repository on, checkout `refs/remotes/<domain>/<path>.git/<branch name>'.
    As this is a mirror, deleted repositories will be synchronized as ref
    deletions, in which case you have to manually dereference the relevant
    commit ID from this info ref to retrieve the commit at the tip of what
    once was the branch using said ID.  This is a difficult process -- but
    know that repositories are deleted for a reason (like merging branches
    that were once useful to host in separate repositories, but are less so
    now that the whole project is archived and inactively updated anyways. :)
